## Project Introduction



[HivisionIDPhotos](https://github.com/Zeyi-Lin/HivisionIDPhotos) is a practical and systematic algorithm for intelligently producing ID photos, utilizing a comprehensive AI model workflow to recognize various user photo scenarios, perform image matting, and generate ID photos, thereby comprehensively enhancing the efficiency and standardization of ID photo production. This product provides an out-of-the-box HivisionIDPhotos based on the Huawei Cloud EulerOS 2.0 64-bit system of Kunpeng servers.

## Core Features

- **Fully automatic generation of standard ID photos:** Support one-click generation of ID photos that comply with Chinese and international standards (such as passports, visas, ID cards, resumes, etc.), automatically cropping the size, adjusting the resolution and background color, meeting the needs of various official scenarios
- **Intelligent portrait segmentation and background replacement:** Based on a high-precision portrait segmentation model, it can accurately identify detailed areas such as hair and ears, achieve natural and smooth background replacement (such as blue background, white background, red background), and have no jagged edges or residue
- **Lightweight and efficient, running locally:** Pure Python implementation, supports running on local devices without uploading photos to the cloud, ensuring user privacy and security, while adapting to PC and edge devices for fast processing
- **Multi scenario adaptation capability:** Support automatic conversion from daily life photos to compliant ID photos, suitable for various scenarios such as job hunting, exam registration, government affairs, etc., to improve preparation efficiency
